# career-portfolio

In this challenge, I created a professional portfolio using HTML and CSS. The portfolio will be updated with my own work over time. Here are the key requirements I followed:

- The site is divided into sections like About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
- Navigation links were added to easily navigate to different sections.
- A PDF of my resume (not current) is linked.
- I included a recent photo of myself.
- The My Work section showcases sample programs from the bootcamp and placeholder applications that will be updated with more projects.
- Clicking on non-placeholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub.
- The page is designed to be responsive on different screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
- Various links and projects have on hover effects.
